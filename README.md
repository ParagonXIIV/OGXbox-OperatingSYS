# What can you do with this Operating System?
    
    
    You can debug any xbox game
    Plus more a lot more.
    
# How to use this:
    
    You need a usb drive connected to your pc with the zip file unzipped from
    the releases section on this repo.
    Then boot from usb create a partition and launch the operating system.
    
# Next you need to have a working og xbox connected to a networking card in your pc.
# Recommend you get a Networking adapter for internal use in pc:

    Once you are connected launch the server software on your pc that came with this repo.
    Then choose to connect your xbox through local area network.
    After this it will show up after you launch your game up and xbox.
    
# Once this is done go back to your pc where you launched your xbox operating system

    Launch the xbox debug tool:
    After game is running on xbox:
    Then use the command -d -xbox -loadgui -default.xbe
    This will bring up a gui interface to show you the xbox game debugged from here you can pause 
    dump memory addresses etc...
    
# This is what I use for reverse engineering xbox games the time 
    is cut in half with good set of tools.

# I was motivated to create this due to no tools good enough to use
    for my decompilations..
